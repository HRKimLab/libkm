# libpopulation

In the exploratory data analysis phase, you want to visualize data in many different ways and also want to know whether the patterns you observe are statistically significant. libpopulation provides an integrative way of visualizing data, check missing values, and perform relevant statistical tests. You write less, debug less, but get rich results. 
What that practically means is, in a meeting, you have less chances to say "I am sorry but actually that was not significant...". In other words, these functions can potentially make the scientific decision-making process efficient.
