# libpopulation

In the exploratory data analysis phase, you want to visualize data in many different ways and also want to know whether the patterns you observe are statistically significant. libpopulation provides an integrative way of visualizing data, check missing values, and perform relevant statistical tests. You write less, debug less, but get rich results. What that practically means is, you have less chances to talk to your PI "I am sorry but actually that was not significant..." and what that means is that this can potentially makes the scientific decision-making process efficient, meaning that you can get your paper published sooner.
