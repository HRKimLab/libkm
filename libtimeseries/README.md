# libtimeseries
libtimeseries provides an integrative way to plot and manage behavioral and neural time course data. It is specialized in handling seconds-scale data in trial structure with multiple conditions. You can do the following things: Plot raster and moving average (PSTH); save PSTH; load data and plot population time course; analyze multi-dimensional dynamics

see demo_timecourse_data_analysis.m for a demo with detailed comments.

# What you can do

- plot a PSTH
- save a PSTH
- load multiple PSTHs
- filter PSTHs
- combine PSTHs with different time range (e.g., homogenize x axis of PSTHs)
- plot individual or population PSTHs
- perform multi-dimensional population analyses
