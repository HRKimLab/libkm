# libkm
A very practical matlab toolbox for behavioral and neural data analyses. This toolbox helps you not get into the 'singularity point' of graduate students and postdocs - where you loose the tracks of your code and data. 

## [libpopulation](https://github.com/hkim09/libkm/tree/master/libpopulation)
Load analysis results and plot them with simple stats.

## [libtimecourse](https://github.com/hkim09/libkm/tree/master/libtimeseries)
Plot time course and save the results. Combime the results and plot population time courses.

## [libutil](https://github.com/hkim09/libkm/tree/master/libutil)
A collection of misc functions
